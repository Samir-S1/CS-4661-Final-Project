# AQS Air Quality Data Analysis Framework

This framework provides a systematic approach for our analysis of EPA Air Quality System (AQS) data. We designed the system to handle large-scale atmospheric monitoring datasets efficiently through SQLite database management and computational analysis tools.

```

## Prerequisites

We need the following Python dependencies for our analysis environment:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib plotly scikit-learn jupyter ipykernel sqlite3 pathlib
```

Alternatively, we can install from a requirements file:

```
pandas>=1.5.0
numpy>=1.21.0
matplotlib>=3.5.0
plotly>=5.0.0
scikit-learn>=1.0.0
jupyter>=1.0.0
ipykernel>=6.0.0
```

## Data Acquisition Protocol

### EPA AQS Data Repository Access

We need to obtain air quality monitoring data from the EPA's official AQS Pre-Generated Data Files repository:

**Primary Data Source**: https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html

Our framework supports hourly atmospheric monitoring data, typically containing millions of measurement records per annual dataset. Data files are distributed in CSV format and range from 1-2 GB per year depending on monitoring network density and parameter coverage.

### Data Placement

We should place downloaded EPA datasets in the `data/` directory within the project structure. The framework automatically detects and processes appropriately named files following EPA naming conventions.

## Data Processing Workflow

### Database Loading Script

We can use the primary data ingestion tool through the interactive loading script:

```bash
python scripts/load_data.py
```

This script provides a command-line interface that allows us to:

- Load raw CSV files into SQLite databases
- Manage multiple datasets simultaneously
- Create standardized table structures
- Establish primary analysis tables

The loading process converts CSV data into optimized SQLite database format, enabling efficient querying of multi-million record datasets. We should expect processing time to scale with dataset size, typically requiring 3-5 minutes per million records.

### SQL Analysis Environment

The `sql/` directory contains a comprehensive collection of queries for systematic data analysis. These pre-written queries enable us to:

- Perform database schema exploration and metadata analysis
- Execute statistical aggregations across the full dataset
- Conduct temporal and spatial filtering operations
- Generate summary statistics and data quality assessments
- Extract specific subsets for focused analysis

The SQL queries are designed to work efficiently with multi-million record datasets, utilizing database-level operations to minimize memory usage and processing time. We can execute these queries directly through database management tools or integrate them into our analytical workflows.

## Computational Analysis Environment

### Jupyter Notebook Interface

We can access the primary analysis environment through Jupyter notebooks:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/aqs_data_visualization.ipynb
```

The notebook environment provides:

- Interactive data visualization capabilities
- Statistical analysis and modeling tools
- Comprehensive dataset exploration functions
- Publication-quality figure generation

### Performance Considerations

We should note that certain analytical operations require extended processing time:

- Database connection and schema inspection: 30-60 seconds
- Comprehensive dataset analysis: 2-5 minutes
- Interactive visualization rendering: 1-3 minutes
- Large-scale aggregation queries: 1-5 minutes depending on dataset size

## Analytical Capabilities

### Database Query Strategies

The framework implements efficient querying strategies for large datasets:

- Temporal subsetting for focused time-series analysis
- Geographic filtering for regional studies
- Statistical aggregation at the database level
- Random sampling for exploratory analysis

### Data Processing Methods

The system provides tools for:

- Multi-temporal dataset management
- Spatial and temporal data filtering
- Statistical normalization and transformation
- Quality assurance and data validation
- Missing data identification and handling

## Research Applications

Our framework supports various atmospheric research applications including:

- Long-term trend analysis of air quality parameters
- Spatial distribution studies of atmospheric pollutants
- Temporal pattern recognition in monitoring data
- Environmental health impact assessments
- Air quality model validation studies
- Policy effectiveness evaluation

## Technical Implementation

SQLite provides database management with:

- Offline operation capability
- Efficient indexing for large datasets
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Integration with Python analytical tools
- Minimal infrastructure requirements

## Usage Guidelines

We should follow this general workflow:

1. Acquire relevant datasets from EPA AQS repository
2. Execute data loading scripts to establish local databases
3. Utilize SQL analysis tools for initial data exploration
4. Conduct detailed analysis using Jupyter notebook environment
5. Export results and visualizations for publication

The modular design allows us to adapt individual components to specific research requirements while maintaining data processing consistency and computational efficiency.
