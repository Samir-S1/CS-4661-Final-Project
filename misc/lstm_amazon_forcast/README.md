## Step-by-Step Code Explanation

This section provides a detailed walkthrough of every cell in the **modernized** notebook, designed for someone with no prior LSTM knowledge.

**Note:** The original tutorial from the YouTube video contained several deprecated code patterns that would cause warnings or errors in modern Python environments. This version has been completely updated to use current best practices while maintaining the same educational value.

### Why Modernization Was Necessary

The original tutorial had several issues that made it incompatible with modern Python environments:

1. **Deprecated pandas operations** - The original used `.shift()` with `inplace=True` which causes `SettingWithCopyWarning`
2. **Old string formatting** - Used `%` and `.format()` instead of modern f-strings
3. **Inefficient tensor handling** - Direct tensor conversions without proper device management
4. **Missing `.detach()` calls** - Caused tensor conversion warnings in newer PyTorch versions
5. **Poor visualization practices** - Plots lacked performance metrics and professional formatting

### Cell 1: Import Libraries and Load Data

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

data = pd.read_csv('AMZN.csv')
data
```

**What this does:**

- **pandas**: Library for handling data in tables (like Excel spreadsheets)
- **numpy**: Library for mathematical operations on arrays of numbers
- **matplotlib**: Library for creating graphs and charts
- **torch**: PyTorch library for deep learning
- **torch.nn**: Neural network components from PyTorch
- Loads Amazon stock data from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame (think of it as a spreadsheet)

### Cell 2: Select Relevant Columns

```python
data = data[['Date', 'Close']]
data
```

**What this does:**

- Keeps only the 'Date' and 'Close' columns from the original data
- 'Close' is the stock's closing price for each day
- We focus on closing prices because they represent the final agreed-upon value each trading day

### Cell 3: Set Computing Device

```python
device = 'cuda:0' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu'
device
```

**What this does:**

- Checks if a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is available for faster computation
- If GPU available, uses 'cuda:0' (first GPU), otherwise uses 'cpu' (regular processor)
- GPUs can train neural networks much faster than CPUs

### Cell 4: Visualize Stock Price Data (Modernized)

```python
# Fix the copy warning by creating a proper copy
data = data.copy()
data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Date'])

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(data['Date'], data['Close'])
plt.title('Amazon Stock Price Over Time')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Close Price ($)')
plt.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
plt.show()
```

**What this does:**

- **Modern fix**: Creates proper copy with `.copy()` to avoid pandas warnings
- Converts the 'Date' column from text to actual date format
- **Enhanced visualization**: Professional plotting with proper labels and grid
- Creates a line graph showing how Amazon's stock price changed over time
- This helps us visualize the patterns we want our LSTM to learn

### Cell 5: Prepare Data for LSTM (Fully Modernized)

```python
def prepare_dataframe_for_lstm(df, n_steps):
    """
    Prepare DataFrame for LSTM by creating lagged features.

    Args:
        df: DataFrame with Date and Close columns
        n_steps: Number of historical steps to use as features

    Returns:
        DataFrame with shifted features
    """
    df = dc(df)

    # Set index without inplace to avoid chained assignment warnings
    df = df.set_index('Date')

    # Create lagged features
    for i in range(1, n_steps+1):
        df[f'Close(t-{i})'] = df['Close'].shift(i)

    # Remove rows with NaN values
    df = df.dropna()

    return df

lookback = 7
shifted_df = prepare_dataframe_for_lstm(data, lookback)
```

**What this does:**

- **Modern fix**: Eliminates `inplace=True` operations that cause warnings
- **Professional documentation**: Added comprehensive docstring
- **Warning-free**: Uses proper pandas patterns to avoid `SettingWithCopyWarning`
- **Time series magic**: Creates "windows" of historical data for the LSTM to learn from
- **Lookback = 7**: Uses 7 previous days to predict the next day
- **shift()**: Moves data backwards in time to create features like "price 1 day ago", "price 2 days ago", etc.
- Creates columns: Close(t-1), Close(t-2), ..., Close(t-7) alongside current Close
- **Why this works**: Stock prices often follow patterns - if we know the last 7 days, we might predict tomorrow

### Cell 6: Convert to NumPy Array

```python
shifted_df_as_np = shifted_df.to_numpy()
```

**What this does:**

- Converts the pandas DataFrame to a NumPy array (a grid of numbers)
- Neural networks work better with NumPy arrays than pandas DataFrames
- Think of it as converting from a spreadsheet to a mathematical matrix

### Cell 7: Check Data Shape

```python
shifted_df_as_np.shape
```

**What this does:**

- Shows the dimensions of our data: (number of rows, number of columns)
- Helps verify we have the right amount of data in the right format

### Cell 8: Scale the Data

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
scaler = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(-1, 1))
shifted_df_as_np = scaler.fit_transform(shifted_df_as_np)
```

**What this does:**

- **Critical step**: Scales all numbers to be between -1 and 1
- **Why necessary**: Neural networks learn better when all input values are in similar ranges
- **MinMaxScaler**: Takes the minimum and maximum values and squishes everything proportionally between -1 and 1
- **Example**: If prices range from $100-$200, $150 becomes 0, $100 becomes -1, $200 becomes +1

### Cell 9: Separate Features (X) and Target (y)

```python
X = shifted_df_as_np[:, 1:]  # All columns except the first
y = shifted_df_as_np[:, 0]   # Only the first column
```

**What this does:**

- **X (features)**: The 7 previous days' prices that we'll use to make predictions
- **y (target)**: The current day's price that we want to predict
- **Machine learning logic**: Given X (historical prices), predict y (current price)

### Cell 10: Reverse the Order of Features

```python
X = dc(np.flip(X, axis=1))
```

**What this does:**

- Flips the order so oldest day comes first, newest day comes last
- **LSTM preference**: LSTMs work better when they process time in chronological order
- Changes from [today-1, today-2, ..., today-7] to [today-7, today-6, ..., today-1]

### Cell 11: Calculate Train/Test Split Point

```python
split_index = int(len(X) * 0.95)
```

**What this does:**

- Calculates where to split data into training and testing sets
- **95% for training**: Model learns from 95% of the data
- **5% for testing**: Model gets evaluated on unseen 5% to check if it really learned patterns (not just memorized)

### Cell 12: Split Data into Train and Test Sets

```python
X_train = X[:split_index]
X_test = X[split_index:]
y_train = y[:split_index]
y_test = y[split_index:]
```

**What this does:**

- **Training data**: Historical price windows and their corresponding actual prices for the model to learn from
- **Testing data**: Separate data the model has never seen, used to evaluate performance
- **Why important**: Tests if the model can generalize to new, unseen market conditions

### Cell 13: Reshape Data for LSTM

```python
X_train = X_train.reshape((-1, lookback, 1))
X_test = X_test.reshape((-1, lookback, 1))
y_train = y_train.reshape((-1, 1))
y_test = y_test.reshape((-1, 1))
```

**What this does:**

- **LSTM requirement**: Reshapes data into the format LSTMs expect
- **3D format for X**: (number of samples, sequence length, number of features)
- **2D format for y**: (number of samples, 1)
- **Example**: Changes from flat array to (samples=1000, sequence_length=7, features=1)

### Cell 14: Convert to PyTorch Tensors

```python
X_train = torch.tensor(X_train).float()
y_train = torch.tensor(y_train).float()
X_test = torch.tensor(X_test).float()
y_test = torch.tensor(y_test).float()
```

**What this does:**

- **Tensor conversion**: Converts NumPy arrays to PyTorch tensors
- **Tensors**: PyTorch's version of arrays that can run on GPUs and compute gradients
- **.float()**: Ensures all numbers are floating-point (decimal) numbers, not integers

### Cell 15: Create Dataset Classes

```python
class TimeSeriesDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, X, y):
        self.X = X
        self.y = y
    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.X)
    def __getitem__(self, i):
        return self.X[i], self.y[i]

train_dataset = TimeSeriesDataset(X_train, y_train)
test_dataset = TimeSeriesDataset(X_test, y_test)
```

**What this does:**

- **PyTorch requirement**: Creates dataset objects that PyTorch can efficiently load during training
- **Like a librarian**: Organizes the data so the training process can request specific samples
- **Batch loading**: Enables loading data in small groups (batches) rather than one at a time

### Cell 16-17: Create Data Loaders

```python
batch_size = 16
train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True)
test_loader = DataLoader(test_dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=False)
```

**What this does:**

- **Batch processing**: Groups data into batches of 16 samples each
- **shuffle=True**: Randomly mixes training data to prevent the model from learning the order
- **shuffle=False**: Keeps test data in order to maintain time sequence for evaluation
- **Why batches**: More efficient than processing one sample at a time

### Cell 18: Test Data Loader

```python
for _, batch in enumerate(train_loader):
    x_batch, y_batch = batch[0].to(device), batch[1].to(device)
    print(x_batch.shape, y_batch.shape)
    break
```

**What this does:**

- **Verification step**: Checks that data loading works correctly
- **Shape verification**: Ensures batches have the expected dimensions
- **Device transfer**: Moves data to GPU (if available) for faster computation

### Cell 19: Define LSTM Model Architecture (Modernized)

```python
class LSTM(nn.Module):
    """
    LSTM model for time series prediction.

    Args:
        input_size: Number of features per time step
        hidden_size: Number of LSTM units
        num_stacked_layers: Number of LSTM layers
    """
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, num_stacked_layers):
        super().__init__()
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.num_stacked_layers = num_stacked_layers

        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, num_stacked_layers,
                            batch_first=True)

        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        batch_size = x.size(0)
        device = x.device  # Get device from input tensor

        h0 = torch.zeros(self.num_stacked_layers, batch_size, self.hidden_size, device=device)
        c0 = torch.zeros(self.num_stacked_layers, batch_size, self.hidden_size, device=device)

        out, _ = self.lstm(x, (h0, c0))
        out = self.fc(out[:, -1, :])
        return out

model = LSTM(1, 4, 1)
model.to(device)
```

**What this does:**

- **Modern device handling**: Automatically detects device from input tensor
- **Professional documentation**: Added comprehensive docstring
- **Robust architecture**: Proper device management prevents CUDA errors
- **The brain of the operation**: Defines the neural network architecture
- **LSTM layer**: The core component that learns patterns in sequences of stock prices
- **Hidden size = 4**: The LSTM has 4 "memory units" to remember patterns
- **Linear layer (fc)**: Converts LSTM output to a single number (the predicted price)
- **forward()**: Defines how data flows through the network
- **h0, c0**: Initial memory states (starts with zeros, now properly device-aware)

### Cell 20: Define Training Function

```python
def train_one_epoch():
    model.train(True)
    running_loss = 0.0
    for batch_index, batch in enumerate(train_loader):
        x_batch, y_batch = batch[0].to(device), batch[1].to(device)
        output = model(x_batch)
        loss = loss_function(output, y_batch)
        running_loss += loss.item()
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```

**What this does:**

- **Training process**: Defines how the model learns from one complete pass through the training data
- **Forward pass**: Model makes predictions on a batch of data
- **Loss calculation**: Measures how wrong the predictions are compared to actual prices
- **Backward pass**: Calculates how to adjust the model to reduce errors
- **optimizer.step()**: Actually updates the model's parameters to improve performance

### Cell 21: Define Validation Function

```python
def validate_one_epoch():
    model.train(False)
    running_loss = 0.0
    for batch_index, batch in enumerate(test_loader):
        x_batch, y_batch = batch[0].to(device), batch[1].to(device)
        with torch.no_grad():
            output = model(x_batch)
            loss = loss_function(output, y_batch)
            running_loss += loss.item()
```

**What this does:**

- **Evaluation process**: Tests how well the model performs on unseen data
- **model.train(False)**: Puts model in evaluation mode (disables training behaviors)
- **torch.no_grad()**: Disables gradient calculation (saves memory and computation)
- **Performance check**: Measures prediction accuracy without updating the model

### Cell 22: Train the Model

```python
learning_rate = 0.001
num_epochs = 10
loss_function = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    train_one_epoch()
    validate_one_epoch()
```

**What this does:**

- **Training configuration**: Sets up the learning parameters
- **MSELoss**: Measures error as the average of squared differences between predictions and actual values
- **Adam optimizer**: Efficient algorithm for updating model parameters
- **Epochs**: Trains for 10 complete passes through all training data
- **The actual learning**: Model gradually improves its ability to predict stock prices

### Cell 23: Visualize Training Results (Scaled)

```python
with torch.no_grad():
    predicted = model(X_train.to(device)).to('cpu').numpy()

plt.plot(y_train, label='Actual Close')
plt.plot(predicted, label='Predicted Close')
```

**What this does:**

- **Generate predictions**: Uses the trained model to predict training data prices
- **torch.no_grad()**: Disables gradient computation for faster inference
- **Visualization**: Creates a graph comparing actual vs predicted prices
- **Still scaled**: These values are still in the -1 to 1 range, not real dollar amounts

### Cell 24-25: Convert Predictions Back to Real Prices (Training Data)

```python
train_predictions = predicted.flatten()
dummies = np.zeros((X_train.shape[0], lookback+1))
dummies[:, 0] = train_predictions
dummies = scaler.inverse_transform(dummies)
train_predictions = dc(dummies[:, 0])
```

**What this does:**

- **Inverse scaling**: Converts predictions from -1 to 1 scale back to real dollar amounts
- **Dummy array trick**: Creates a temporary array with the right shape for the scaler
- **Real money**: Now predictions are in actual stock price dollars, not scaled values

### Cell 26: Visualize Training Results (Real Prices)

```python
plt.plot(new_y_train, label='Actual Close')
plt.plot(train_predictions, label='Predicted Close')
```

**What this does:**

- **Real dollar visualization**: Shows actual stock prices vs predictions in real money
- **Training performance**: Demonstrates how well the model learned from training data
- **Should look good**: Training results usually look impressive (model has seen this data)

### Cell 27-28: Generate Test Predictions and Convert to Real Prices (Modernized)

```python
# Generate test predictions and convert to original scale
with torch.no_grad():
    model.eval()
    test_predictions = model(X_test.to(device)).detach().cpu().numpy().flatten()

# Convert test predictions back to original scale
dummies = np.zeros((X_test.shape[0], lookback + 1))
dummies[:, 0] = test_predictions
dummies = scaler.inverse_transform(dummies)

test_predictions = dc(dummies[:, 0])
```

**What this does:**

- **Modern tensor handling**: Uses `.detach().cpu().numpy()` to avoid warnings
- **The real test**: Uses the trained model on completely unseen test data
- **True performance**: These results show if the model can actually predict future prices
- **Same inverse scaling**: Converts test predictions back to real dollar amounts
- **Warning-free**: Proper tensor conversion prevents deprecation warnings

### Cell 29: Visualize Test Results (Enhanced Visualization)

```python
# Plot test results in real dollar values
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(test_actuals, label='Actual Close', alpha=0.8, linewidth=2, color='green')
plt.plot(test_predictions, label='Predicted Close', alpha=0.8, linewidth=2, color='red')
plt.xlabel('Day')
plt.ylabel('Close Price ($)')
plt.title('Test Set Predictions vs Actual (Real Dollar Values)')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True, alpha=0.3)

# Calculate and display test metrics
test_mse = np.mean((test_actuals - test_predictions) ** 2)
test_mae = np.mean(np.abs(test_actuals - test_predictions))
test_mape = np.mean(np.abs((test_actuals - test_predictions) / test_actuals)) * 100

# Add metrics to plot
metrics_text = f'Test Metrics:\nMSE: ${test_mse:.2f}\nMAE: ${test_mae:.2f}\nMAPE: {test_mape:.2f}%'
plt.text(0.02, 0.95, metrics_text,
         transform=plt.gca().transAxes, bbox=dict(boxstyle="round", facecolor='lightblue', alpha=0.8),
         verticalalignment='top')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

print(f"\nFinal Model Performance Summary:")
print(f"================================")
print(f"Test Mean Squared Error: ${test_mse:.2f}")
print(f"Test Mean Absolute Error: ${test_mae:.2f}")
print(f"Test Mean Absolute Percentage Error: {test_mape:.2f}%")
print(f"Model Accuracy: {100 - test_mape:.2f}%")
```

## Key LSTM Concepts Explained

**What is an LSTM?**

- **Long Short-Term Memory**: A type of neural network designed to remember patterns across time
- **Memory cells**: Like a person's memory, it can remember important information and forget irrelevant details
- **Perfect for sequences**: Ideal for data where the order matters (like stock prices over time)

**Why LSTMs for Stock Prediction?**

- **Pattern recognition**: Can learn complex patterns in price movements
- **Sequence awareness**: Understands that stock prices are influenced by recent history
- **Adaptive memory**: Learns which historical information is most important for predictions
