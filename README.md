├── misc/               # Temporary workspace and experimental code (not part of final deliverable)
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Samir-S1/CS-4661-Final-Project.git
   cd CS-4661-Final-Project
   ```

2. Review the documentation in each subfolder for environment setup and usage instructions.

## Misc Directory

The `misc/` directory contains temporary experimental code, prototypes, and work-in-progress materials. This directory is frequently cleaned and updated, and its contents are not considered part of the final project deliverable.

## AQS Data Analysis

The `aqs_data_analysis/` folder contains scripts, notebooks, and documentation for the air quality data analysis component of the project. Refer to its README for details on data sources, setup, and analysis workflow.
